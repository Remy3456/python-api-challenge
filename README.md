**Discussion about the linear relationship between Latitude vs. Max Temperature.**
**Northern Hemisphere:** The negative slope of the regression line (-0.57) indicates a strong negative correlation as latitude increases (moving north), the maximum temperature tends to decrease. While the data points are scattered around the regression line, the overall trend is clear. The r² value of 0.77 indicates that 77% of the variation in maximum temperature can be explained by latitude. This suggests that latitude is a strong predictor of temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere.
**Southern Hemisphere:** The positive slope of the regression line (0.35) indicates a weak positive correlation as latitude increases (moving south), the maximum temperature tends to increase slightly. The data points are scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining maximum temperatures. The r² value of 0.48 indicates that only 48% of the variation in maximum temperature can be explained by latitude. This suggests that other factors significantly influence temperature variations.

**Discussion about the linear relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity.**
**Northern Hemisphere:** The positive slope of the regression line (0.29) indicates a weak positive correlation  as latitude increases (moving north), humidity tends to increase slightly. The data points are scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining humidity levels. The R-squared value of 0.08 indicates that only 8% of the variation in humidity can be explained by latitude. This suggests that other factors significantly influence humidity variations.
**Southern Hemisphere:** The positive slope of the regression line (0.07) indicates a very weak positive correlation as latitude increases (moving south), humidity tends to increase slightly. The data points are widely scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining humidity levels. The R-squared value of 0.00 indicates that almost none of the variation in humidity can be explained by latitude. This further confirms the extremely weak relationship between the two variables.

**Discussion about the linear relationship Latitude vs. Cloudiness**
**Northern Hemisphere:**  The positive slope of the regression line (0.48) indicates a weak positive correlation as latitude increases (moving north), cloudiness tends to increase slightly. The data points are scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining cloudiness levels. The R-squared value of 0.05 indicates that only 5% of the variation in cloudiness can be explained by latitude. This suggests that other factors significantly influence cloudiness variations.
**Southern Hemisphere:** The positive slope of the regression line (0.16) indicates a very weak positive correlation as latitude increases (moving south), cloudiness tends to increase slightly. The data points are widely scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining cloudiness levels. The R-squared value of 0.00 indicates that almost none of the variation in cloudiness can be explained by latitude. This further confirms the extremely weak relationship between the two variables.

**Discussion about the linear relationship between Latitude vs Wind Speed.**
**Northern Hemisphere:** The positive slope of the regression line (0.03) indicates a very weak positive correlation as latitude increases (moving north), wind speed tends to increase slightly. The data points are widely scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining wind speed levels. The R-squared value of 0.04 indicates that only 4% of the variation in wind speed can be explained by latitude. This suggests that other factors significantly influence wind speed variations.
**Southern Hemisphere:** The negative slope of the regression line (-0.03) indicates a very weak negative correlation as latitude increases (moving south), wind speed tends to decrease slightly. The data points are widely scattered around the regression line, suggesting that other factors besides latitude play a significant role in determining wind speed levels. The R-squared value of 0.03 indicates that only 3% of the variation in wind speed can be explained by latitude. This suggests that other factors significantly influence wind speed variations.
